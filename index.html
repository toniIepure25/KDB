                De Bruyne was an ambassador for the 2014 Special Olympics, which took place in Antwerp and was involved in a controversial advertisement campaign, via his personal Instagram account. Employing the slogan (in Dutch): "Would you still be my fan if I looked like this?", De Bruyne was depicted resembling a person with Down syndrome.
